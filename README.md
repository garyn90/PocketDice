# PocketDungeon
This is a repository for Pocket Dungeon, a simple single-page dice roller for DnD. This project was made to get acquainted with Bootstrap.

Project is largely done, however I'd like some backend functionality to help people store their sheets, that way they have everything they need to play DnD, right in their browser and mobile device of choice.
